                 <h2>9. <u>Albert's Stain for C.diphtheriae</u></h2>
                 <p>Albert's stain is a laboratory staining technique used to visualise and identify the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is the causative agent of diphtheria. This staining method is named after its developer, Albert, and it helps in the microscopic detection of C. diphtheriae in clinical specimens. Here's an overview of Albert's stain and its application for C. diphtheriae:- </p>
                 <h6>1. Purpose:</h6>
                 <p>The primary purpose of Albert's stain is to identify and confirm the presence of C. diphtheriae in clinical samples, particularly in cases where diphtheria is suspected.</p>
                 <h6>2. Microscopic Examination:</h6>
                 <p> After the staining process, the slide is examined under a light microscope. C. diphtheriae cells stained with Albert's stain typically appear as purple, rod-shaped bacteria against a contrasting background.</p>
                 <h6>3. Application for C. diphtheriae:- </h6>
                <li><b>Corynebacterium diphtheriae:</b>The Albert's stain is used in the diagnosis of diphtheria, a potentially serious and highly contagious bacterial infection. C. diphtheriae is responsible for producing a toxin that can lead to severe respiratory and systemic symptoms. The staining technique helps in identifying the bacteria in clinical specimens obtained from the throat or other affected areas.</li>
                <li>It's important to note that while Albert's stain can identify the presence of C. diphtheriae in clinical samples, additional tests, such as culture and molecular methods, may be necessary for strain typing and confirmation. Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent its spread and complications.</li>
